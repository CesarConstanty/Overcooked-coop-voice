  <div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; gap: 60px; flex-wrap: wrap;">

    <!-- Movement and interactions -->
    <div style="flex: 1; max-width: 500px;">
      <h4>Movement and interactions</h4>
      <img src="static/images/space-arrows.png" style="width:250px; display: block; margin: 0 auto;">
      <p>
        You can move up, down, left, and right using the <b>arrow keys</b>, and interact with objects
        using the <b>spacebar</b>.
      </p>
      <p>
        You can interact with objects by facing them and pressing <b>spacebar</b>. Here are some examples:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Pick up ingredients (onions or tomatoes) by facing the ingredient area and pressing <b>spacebar</b>.</li>
        <li>If you're holding an ingredient and face an empty counter, pressing <b>spacebar</b> puts the item down.</li>
        <li>Face a pot and press <b>spacebar</b> to add an ingredient (if it's not full).</li>
        <li>Face a non-empty pot while holding nothing and press <b>spacebar</b> to begin cooking.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        <u><b>You cannot occupy the same location as your partner.</b></u>
      </p>
    </div>

        <!-- Cooking -->
        <div style="flex: 1; max-width: 500px;">
          <h4>Cooking</h4>
          <img src="static/images/soup.png" style="width:250px; display: block; margin: 0 auto;">
          <p>
            Once an ingredient is in the pot, press <b>spacebar</b> to start cooking. A pot can hold up to 3 ingredients.
          </p>
          <p>
            A red number appears over the pot to indicate cook time. It counts upward until the soup is done.
            Each onion adds {{ current_user.config["onion_time"] }} and each tomato adds {{ current_user.config["tomato_time"] }} to the cook time. Remember that onions 
            grant more points than tomatoes but take longer to be cooked !

      <h3 class="text-center">Your Goal</h3>
      <p>
        For each game, you will have a list of recipes to make.
        The goal of the game is to achieve all these recipes in the shortest possible time.
        Please note that you should complete the recipe list as quickly as possible, but in no specific sequence.
        The <b>All Orders</b> list shows which recipes you have to realize for the game.
        This is important because any soup served that is not on this list will not
        be counted and will just waste your time.
      </p>

      <p>
        When a soup is served at the serving counter, it is automatically validated, and disapear from the
        <b>All Orders</b> list of the recipes you have to realize during the game.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Your goal</b> is to make all the recipes in the "All Orders" list <b>AS FAST AS POSSIBLE</b>.
      </p>

      <img class="center" src="static/images/info-panel_recipe.png" style="width:400px">

      <p> For example, here you have to make 3 soups:
        <ul>
          <li>tomato + tomato + tomato</li>
          <li>tomato + onion</li>
          <li>onion + onion + tomato</li>
        </ul>
      </p>

      <h4 class="text-center">Please pay VERY close attention to this part. It is AS IMPORTANT AS the game itself. </h4>

      <h3 class="text-center">Questions</h3>
      <br>
      <br>

      <h5 class="text-left">After each GAME</h5>
      <p>
        At the end of each game, you will be asked questions, it is very important that you understand what is asked :
      </p>
		
	  <p>
	  1) <b> "How much control did you use ? "</b> : This refers to the actual influence you exerted on what happened. 
	  Think about how much of the outcome resulted from your direct actions or commands.
	  </p>
      <p>
        2) <b> "How much control did you feel ? " </b> : This measures your subjective experience of control, how much it felt like you were the one guiding what happened.
      </p>

      <p>
        3) <b> "Who is accountable for this result ? " </b> : Accountability is about who you believe is mainly responsible for the result: you, the team as a whole, or the artificial agent involved.
      </p>
	  <p>
	  Your goal is to complete the requested recipes as quickly as possible.
        Once the game is complete, you will see how long it took. Then, you'll evaluate how responsible you feel for that outcome.
	  </p>
      <br>

      <h5 class="text-left">After each BLOCK of games</h5>
      <p>
        At the end of each assignment block, you will be asked to complete two questionnaires about the
        games you have just completed.
      </p>

      <h4 class="text-center">It is VERY IMPORTANT to answer the questions SERIOUSLY for the experiment to be valid.</h4>

      <br>

      <br>

      <h3 class="text-center">Course of the experiment</h3>
      <p>You will start by performing a tutorial to familiarize yourself with the interface.</p>
      <p>You will start each block with a practice trial to learn how to play with the agent.
        This trial will look like other trials but we wont use the data collected.</p>
      <p>Then you will start the experiment where you will complete 3 blocks containing 11 games each.</p>
      <p>You will be able to take a small break between each block if you wish.</p>
	  <p>Keep in mind that every survey is to mean to be completed in a certain amount of time</p>
