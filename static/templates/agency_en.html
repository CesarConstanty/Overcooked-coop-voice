    <div class="question">
      <p><strong>How much control did you use?</strong></p>
      <p>This refers to the actual influence you exerted on what happened. Think about how much of the outcome resulted from your direct actions or commands.</p>
      <input type="range" name="q1" min="0" max="100" value="50">
      <div class="label-row"><span>Low control (0)</span><span>High control (100)</span></div>
    </div>

    <div class="question">
      <p><strong>How much control did you feel?</strong></p>
      <p>This measures your subjective experience of control, how much it felt like you were the one guiding what happened.</p>
      <input type="range" name="q2" min="0" max="100" value="50">
      <div class="label-row"><span>Low control (0)</span><span>High control (100)</span></div>
    </div>

    <div class="question">
      <p><strong>Who is accountable for this result ("score")?</strong></p>
      <p>Accountability is about who you believe is mainly responsible for the result : you, the team as a whole, or the artificial agent involved.</p>
      <input type="range" name="q3" min="0" max="100" value="50">
      <div class="label-row"><span>Me (0)</span><span>The team (50)</span><span>Artificial agent (100)</span></div>
    </div>
